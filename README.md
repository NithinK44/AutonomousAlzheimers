Alzheimer's disease (Ad) is a disease that becomes more and more inhibiting 
of memory with a progressive course over time it also affects thinking and 
causes visual impairment. Visual impairment is a customary symptom of AD, 
and recent studies have shown that visual interventions may improve the 
functioning of AD patients. This paper aims to use image processing 
techniques to detect AD at an early stage using Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI) of the brain. The proposed technique also includes camera-based 
detection for visually impaired or AD individuals to recognize text, objects 
and known people in real-time using face recognition and sign language. 
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) method is used to transform pictures to 
text, and ML is used to detect known faces, objects and sign language. The 
output will be expressed in the form of an audio stream with the help of test 
to speech
